This is my personal repository for the course of Information Theory for Complex Systems!

Each file of code will under its respective folder, I'll make sure to label them accurately as to not have any ambiguities.

NOTE:
I write mostly in Python, and whenever I submit a Python file I will submit both a .py and a .ipynb version. They will be identical!
